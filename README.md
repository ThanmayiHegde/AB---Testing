# AB-Testing
A/B testing is the experimentation of two versions of an element in order to determine which works better.
A/B Testing enables us to determine whether changes in landing pages, popup forms, article titles, and other digital marketing decisions improve conversion rates and ultimately customer purchasing behavior.
# Hypothesis based on converted rates:
H_O : p(new)-p(old)<=0 old has better conversion

H_1 : p(new)-p(old)>0 new has better conversion
# Models Used:
1. Logistic Regression Model

2. Multiple Linear Regression Model

3. Decission Trees
#Final Conclusion:
1.Our implementation shows that the old page is better since it has a higher probability of conversion rate than the new page.


2.No significant difference is observed in the conversion rate depending on whether the user has received the old page or the new page.  


3.External factors such as location, novelty, history, etc does not affect the conversion rates.


4.Both multiple linear regression model and decision tree model obtained very close RMSE values. Hence, either of the two models could be used for predicting the conversion rates.
